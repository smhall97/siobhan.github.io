    "description": "The *World Wide Recipe* Addressing the 'Western gaze' in AI training data by building a dataset from the ground up using community networks in Africa and beyond. Collected 765 unique dishes across 106 countries, with names in 131 local languages. Over 50% of community-sourced dishes did not exist in comparable web-scraped datasets, proving the limits of automated scraping.",

    "description": "Built a dataset of 690 images covering 23 occupations to benchmark gender bias in vision-language models. Evaluated 6 vision-language encoders (including CLIP, OpenCLIP, SLIP) and 2 captioning models (BLIP-2, GIT). Found that in different-gender scenes, vision-language encoders performed worse than random chance, proving they rely on bag-of-words correlations rather than true compositional understanding.",

    "description": "Proposed an adversarial learning framework to debias vision-language models without large-scale retraining. Used frozen CLIP encoders with learnable prompt tokens and multi-layer perceptron adversaries. Jointly optimised adversarial loss and image-text contrastive loss, achieving less than 1% drop in zero-shot ImageNet accuracy whilst reducing bias. Discovered that standard NLP bias metrics (WEAT) were mathematically brittle in multimodal contexts.",

    "title": "SMRS: Advocating a Unified Reporting Standard for Surrogate Models",
    "description": "Scientific and engineering problems, from climate prediction to drug discovery, often depend on surrogate models: simplified, data-driven models that approximate expensive simulations or experiments. These surrogates save enormous amounts of time and computation but are developed in very different ways across disciplines. As a result, it is often impossible to reproduce, compare, or reuse them, even when code and data are available. This paper argues that the field needs a shared way to report how surrogate models are built, trained, and tested. We introduce the Surrogate Model Reporting Specification (SMRS), a lightweight checklist that captures key design choices, such as how data were collected, what type of model was used, how uncertainty was handled, and how performance was evaluated. SMRS is not a new algorithm; it is a structured way to describe existing ones so that other researchers can understand and replicate them. By introducing a consistent reporting standard, we aim to make surrogate modelling more transparent, comparable, and trustworthy, ultimately accelerating progress across many scientific fields in the age of artificial intelligence.",
