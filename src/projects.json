    "description": "Addressing the 'Western gaze' in AI training data by building a dataset from the ground up using community networks in Africa and beyond. Collected 765 unique dishes across 106 countries, with names in 131 local languages. Over 50% of community-sourced dishes did not exist in comparable web-scraped datasets, proving the limits of automated scraping.",

    "description": "Built a dataset of 690 images covering 23 occupations to benchmark gender bias in vision-language models. Evaluated 6 vision-language encoders (including CLIP, OpenCLIP, SLIP) and 2 captioning models (BLIP-2, GIT). Found that in different-gender scenes, vision-language encoders performed worse than random chance, proving they rely on bag-of-words correlations rather than true compositional understanding.",

    "title": "A Prompt Array Keeps the Bias Away: Debiasing Vision-Language Models with Adversarial Learning",
    "description": "Proposed an adversarial learning framework to debias vision-language models without large-scale retraining. Used frozen CLIP encoders with learnable prompt tokens and multi-layer perceptron adversaries. Jointly optimised adversarial loss and image-text contrastive loss, achieving less than 1% drop in zero-shot ImageNet accuracy whilst reducing bias. Discovered that standard NLP bias metrics (WEAT) were mathematically brittle in multimodal contexts.",

Implemented adaptive meshing to resolve high-gradient areas near electrodes whilst saving computational resources. Built surrogate models using artificial neural networks in PyTorch to predict neural activation, significantly reducing computational demands compared to full biophysical simulations.",
